                                <h4>I am 30 years old. I was born and live in Kharkov. Most of my life I was engaged in creativity, art.
                                But in 2017, I discovered the world of web development. I really wanted to develop web applications, sites
                                but could not understand where to start. I watched a lot of information on the Internet, trying to figure out what
                                to start with. Many forums wrote that without knowledge of the OOP in the world WEB is difficult and I began to learn Java.I am a very persistent and purposeful person.
                                Having studied the basics of the Java language itself, I decided to take courses to consolidate my knowledge. In parallel with the study of programming, I learn English.
                                After taking Java courses, a friend of mine advised me to learn PHP, Laravel, and WordPress. On the Internet, I found a unique course
                                from webformyself.com in which I am doing at the moment. I am very motivated in deep learning of the Laravel framework, CMS WordPress and
                                    other technologies related to web development.</h4>
